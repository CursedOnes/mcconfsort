# mcconfsort

Sort table entries inside .toml and .json files, recursively inside a directory.

It can also preserve comments and indentation inside toml files (but not json).

This is made e.g. for Minecraft modpacks to help versioning configs, as the toml/json contents are ordered randomly.

## Install

```
cargo install -f --git https://github.com/CursedOnes/mcconfsort
```
